# Nearest Neighbour Optimization

Git repository for the exercise described in `TASK.md`.

You can install this package with `pip`:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/peterprescott/optimize-nn
```

You can then profile the solutions:

```
python -m opt_nn.profile
```

![Comparison of solutions](img/comparison.png)

The kd-tree solutions are still not quite fully functional. For more
detail, read the [report](./pdf/report_default.pdf), or just the
[issue](https://github.com/peterprescott/optimize-nn/issues/8).
